Intermediate R for Spatial Analysis Course on Fri 4th March 2016

Hi,

Thank you for signing up to attend the Intermediate R for Spatial Analysis course on Friday 4th March. This email includes details of the times and locations of the course, as well as instructions for entering the Sydney Jones Library. If you have any questions, please contact me (n.bearman@liverpool.ac.uk) or Becca in Management Services (soesms@liverpool.ac.uk).

As you will know from the course description, this course will be building on your previous knowledge of spatial data and RStudio. If you have previously attended the Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis or are attending the Introduction to R as a GIS on Thursday 3rd March (they are the same course, just with a different name) then this has covered everything you need to know. 

If you haven't (or even if you have and want a quick refresher!) I would recommend you review the Introduction material, available at: https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis. Being familiar with this will enable you to get a lot more from the course on Friday!

Registration will take place from 9:30am in the Staff Meeting Room (215), Sydney Jones Library, University of Liverpool. Details of how to get here are online at: http://www.liv.ac.uk/maps/visiting/, and a campus map at http://www.liv.ac.uk/files/docs/maps/liverpool-university-campus-map.pdf (Sydney Jones Library is building number 423 in grid F3 on the map). When you enter the Library, go up to the second floor, and follow the signs. 

The session will start officially at 9:45am. If you are going to be later than this, please let me know. (A full, provisional, schedule is included at the end of this email). In the afternoon, there is likely to be an opportunity to spend some time working on your own data. If you have any data you are working on, please send me a sample (so I know what type of data to expect) and bring it along and I can have some time with you on a one-to-one basis. 

If you are not from the University of Liverpool, please bring photo ID to access the library. Reception will have a list of participants, and they will be able to issue you with a day pass. Please also have proof of student or staff status to show me when I register you (campus card or similar is fine). 

I would like to share the name, email address and organisation of everyone attending the course with the rest of the participants. The course is a great networking opportunity, and I would like you all to be able to make the most of it. If you do not wish your name and email to be shared in this way, please let me know. I would also like to take some photos during the day (for publicity) so if you do not wish to be in the photos, please let me know (via email or on the day). 

If you have any learning requirements or dietary preferences you have not already mentioned, please let myself or Becca know ASAP. 

If you have any problems on the day, or can't find the room, my mobile number is 07717745715. 

I'm looking forward to seeing you on Friday 4th March.

Best wishes,
Nick.
