Which is the best classification method?
Equal Interval
Natural Breaks / Jenks / Fisher
Standard Deviation
It depends on what you are trying to show in the data
It depends on the distribution of the data

If we want to see how many points are in a polygon, what analysis do we use?
Polygon on Point
Point in Polygon
Union
Point over Polygon

What coordinate system are these coordinates likely to be in?  619301 307416
British National Grid (Eastings & Northings) EPSG = 27700
UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) Zone 37 N EPSG = 32630
Latitude and Longitude (WGS 1984) EPSG = 4326

Day 2 recap:

When working with grouped data, like Census data which is individual surveys grouped at the Output Area level, what do we need to remember?

How old is the data
Be careful of the MAUP (Modifiable Areal Unit Problem) when the boundaries of grouped data influence the outcome of analysis done using the data
Be aware that we risk making an Ecological Fallacy, if we assume everyone in a (deprived) area is (deprived)
All of the above

What is the main difference between Moran's I and LISA?
Moran's I uses queen weights, LISA uses rook weights
Moran's I measures global patterns, LISA measures local clusters
Moran's I is for points, LISA is for polygons
There is no difference, they are the same statistic

What does the following R code accomplish?
tram_stations <- st_as_sf(metrolink_stations_CSV, coords = c('GMGRFE', 'GMGRFN'), crs = 27700)

Converts a regular dataframe into a spatial points dataframe with British National Grid coordinates
Filters the metrolink stations dataset to only show stations with valid coordinates
Performs a spatial join of the metrolink_stations_CSV file with the tram_stations file
Creates a buffer zone at 600m around the tram stations
